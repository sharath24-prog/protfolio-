# Game Developer Portfolio

## 🎮 About
This is my personal **Game Developer Portfolio** created using **only HTML and CSS**.

I designed and developed this project completely on my own.  
All code, layout, and styling are original and written from scratch without using templates, frameworks, or copied code.

This portfolio represents my interest in game development and my journey as a learner and creator.
